Plugin for bukkit & craftbukkit (Minecraft Server Mod). Fills in bedrock voids on level 0 and converts bedrock to stone on levels 1-4 (Flat bedrock)

disabled worldlistener/onchunkloaded until bukkit fixes the behaviour
toadd: as soon as bukkit supports loadedChunks flatting bedrock at server/plugin start will be added, in addition onChunkLoaded will ftlat bedrock on new chunks while playing
